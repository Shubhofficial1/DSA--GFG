Arrays can be categorised on the basic of size as below

1. Fixed Size Array
2. Dynamic Sized Array

Fixed sized arrays are those arrays in which the size of the array is defined already &
we can't update the size in case of need.

For example : 

C\C++ : int arr[100] => stack allocated
        int arr[n]   => stack allocated
        int *arr = new int[n]  => heap allocated(Dynamically allocated memory)
        int arr[] = {10,20,30,40,50}  =>stack allocated

Java  : int [] arr = new int[100]     => heap allocated
        int [] arr = new int[n]       => heap allocated
        int arr[] = {10,20,30,40,50}  => heap allocated

While In the case of Dynamic Sized array , internal implementation can be used to make use of 
new space in case of need.

For example :   
C++ : Vector
Java : Arraylist
Python : List
